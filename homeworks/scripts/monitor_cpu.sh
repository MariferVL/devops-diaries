# Note: For production environments, consider creating a system service
# to run this script continuously. This ensures the script runs in the
# background and restarts automatically if it fails. See the following
# steps to create a system service for this script:
# 1. Create a service file in /etc/systemd/system/monitor_cpu.service
# 2. Add the necessary service configuration
# 3. Reload systemd with 'sudo systemctl daemon-reload'
# 4. Start the service with 'sudo systemctl start monitor_cpu.service'
# 5. Enable the service to start on boot with 'sudo systemctl enable monitor_cpu.service'
