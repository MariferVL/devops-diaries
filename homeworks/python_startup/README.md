# **Python Tutorial: DevOps Edition**

Welcome to this simple Python OOP tutorial, designed to introduce basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming with a developer-themed twist. This tutorial will guide you through setting up the environment, running the code, and understanding the concepts involved.

## **Setting Up Your Environment**

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, it's important to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Open your terminal and run the following command to create the virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Windows**:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
- On **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### 3. Install the Dependencies

While the example code doesn't have external dependencies right now, it's good practice to create a `requirements.txt` file. This will help you manage any future dependencies for the project:

```bash
echo colorama > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Running the Program**

### 4. Get the `main.py` Code

Instead of writing the code manually, you can easily retrieve it from the repository. Simply visit the following link to access the `main.py` file:

[main.py - DevOps Diaries Repo](https://github.com/MariferVL/devops-diaries/blob/main/homeworks/python_startup/main.py)

Copy the entire code from this file and paste it into a new file named `main.py` in your project folder.

### 5. Run the Program

After saving your file, run the program with:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will prompt you for your name and ask whether you want to be a "frontend" or "backend" developer.

## **Customizing Your Version**

Now that you've set up the environment and the code, you can experiment with it! Try to:

- Change the developer's languages or frameworks.
- Modify how the deployment works.
- Create your own developer classes for other roles.
- Add more functionality or fun messages to the program.

Feel free to get creative!

Happy coding!
